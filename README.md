## How to run (locally)

- Ensure you have npm installed `npm -v`. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- Once npm is installed, run the following commands:
    1. `npm install` - Installs all necessary dependencies
    2. `npm start` - Starts the app on port 3000

## Branch standards
- Keep each branch limited to solve single ticket, or add single feature.
- Name branch as `{ticket ID}-{short description}`
    - e.g. `26-pr-template`

## Git commit standards
- Keep messages short (under 50 chars) but descriptive.  
- Commit as logical units rather than with every file change.
